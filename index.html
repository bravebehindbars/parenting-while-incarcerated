      <p>In 2025, nearly half of all parents in state and federal prisons have children under 18.</p>
      <p>
        Specifically, about 47% of state prisoners and 58% of federal prisoners are parents, according to the 
        <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/parents-prison-and-their-minor-children-survey-prison-inmates-2016"><br>Bureau of Justice Statistics Website.</a>
        <br>This translates to a significant number of children affected by parental incarceration, with some estimates suggesting over 200,000 children each year have a parent in prison.

      <h1 class="text-center"><b>Impact On Children</b></h1>
      <p>
        The incarceration of a parent has far-reaching consequences for children, including increased risk of emotional, behavioral, and learning difficulties, according to the 
        <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/when-a-parent-goes-to-prison-what-happens-to-the-kids" target="_blank" class="text-info">Institute for Family Studies</a>.
        They may experience academic struggles, like lower grades, and be more likely to face disciplinary issues at school.
        <br><br>
        <b>Behavioral Problems:</b> These emotional challenges can manifest as behavioral problems, such as aggression, difficulty forming relationships, and social withdrawal.
        <br>
        <b>Social Challenges:</b> Relationships with peers and social interactions can be negatively affected, potentially leading to isolation and loneliness.
        <br>
        <b>Increased Risk of Future Involvement in the Justice System:</b> Studies show that children of incarcerated parents are at a higher risk of becoming involved in the juvenile or criminal justice system themselves.
        <br>
        <b>Reduced Family Stability:</b> The absence of a parent can disrupt family dynamics and create instability, impacting the child's sense of security and belonging.
        <br>
        <b>Caregiver Strain:</b> Caregivers, often grandparents or other relatives, may face significant challenges in providing for the child's needs, both emotionally and financially.

      <h1 class="text-center"><b>Financial Burdens</b></h1>
      <p>
        Families shoulder a significant financial burden due to incarceration, with some estimates suggesting families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative. In total, families incur nearly $350 billion in annual costs tied to incarceration.
        <br><br>
        <b>Lost Income:</b> Incarceration leads to a decline in family income for one in five families, with an average loss of $1,803 per month.
        <br>
        <b>Court-Related Costs:</b> Families often bear the brunt of court-related fines and fees, with 63% of families being primarily responsible for these costs.
        <br>
        <b>Inability to Meet Basic Needs:</b> 65% of families struggle to meet basic needs like food and housing due to the financial strain of incarceration.
        <br>
        <b>Long-Term Economic Impact:</b> Incarceration can negatively affect the incarcerated person's future earnings and job prospects, impacting the family's long-term financial stability.
        <br>
        <b>Debt:</b> Many families incur debt to pay for phone calls and visits to maintain contact with incarcerated family members.
        <br>
        <b>Child Support:</b> Incarceration can lead to difficulties in meeting child support obligations, and some recommend debt restructuring and suspension programs.

  <!-- Section: Contact with Children -->

    <div class="checker pt-3 my-4 border bg-dark text-white">
      <h1 class="text-center"><b>Contact with Children</b></h1>
      <p>
        Many incarcerated parents struggle to maintain contact with their children, with factors like distance, reluctance from the child's other parent, and the cost of visits contributing to reduced contact. Having contact between the incarcerated parent and their children is highly important for both the parent and the children. It can mitigate the negative impacts of parental incarceration, reduce the likelihood of future criminal behavior by the parent, and promote positive outcomes for the children.
        <br><br>
        <b>Improved Well-being:</b> Maintaining contact with an incarcerated parent can help children cope with the trauma of separation, reduce feelings of grief and loss, and provide a sense of stability. For the parent it can help improve in-prison behavior.
        <br>
        <b>Stronger Family Ties:</b> Contact can help maintain or strengthen family bonds, which can be a protective factor against future involvement in the criminal justice system.
